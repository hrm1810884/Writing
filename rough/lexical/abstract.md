# üìù Lexical Integration

## üìò Background

In the conventional EGP Article system, we used an in-house markdown editor to build our article creation functionality. However, we recognized the need for a markdown editor with advanced features similar to those offered by Notion and Confluence. 

Consequently, we turned our attention to Lexical, a rich text editor provided by Meta, and conducted a study to evaluate its integration into the EGP Article functionality. 

## What is Lexical?

Lexical is an extensible JavaScript web text-editor framework provided by Meta, and Lexical has high customizability and functionality.
